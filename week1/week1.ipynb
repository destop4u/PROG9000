    "# Week 1 - Background to Python and Basic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "_Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace._\n",
    "\n",
    "_It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales._\n",
    "\n",
    " - It is used in many domains, ranging from web development, to data science, robots, astrophysics, music, linguistics and.... GIS! \n",
    " - It is seen as a language that is easy to learn, but can be used for very large and complex projects. Well known users of Python include WIkipedia, Google, Dropbox, NASA.. Software for small arduinos to Boeing 787s can and is written in Python.\n",
    " - It has a modular structure - you import a library with code to perform a particular task. for example, the `pandas` library is used for data analysis, and allows manipulation of data in tabular format, kind of like Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to use and write Python. This is a `Jupyter Notebook` - it is a way to write nicely formatted text in the form of markdown in the same page as a piece of code.\n"

    "Like most programming languages, Python stores data in different ways depending on the type of the data. For example, storing something as a `numeric` type means that it can have mathematical operations performed on it. Or if it is of `string` type, it can have operations performed on it that are specific to words and characters. Python will automatically assign the value to a variable which is of the appropriate type. For instance, in the cell below, 4 gets assigned to an int type - it is obviously an integer. A foating point number is just another represention of a number, with a slightly different structure. This is done to help with memory use."
