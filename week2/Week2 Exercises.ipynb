    "1. Look at the documentation for lists at https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/ and/or https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pick out three _methods_ that are implemented by the list object, and describe what they do. Write some pseudocode (code that doesn't have to run but makes logical sense) that shows how each method might be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. How would you implement a counter in a `for` loop? That is, as you iterate through the items in a sequence, how do you count how many times you run the loop? Show this with pseudocode.\n",
    "\n",
    "    How would you just output every third item?\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What module would you import for;\n",
    " - working with directories and paths\n",
    " - working with dates and times\n",
    " - working with common data interchange formats (google might help...)  \n",
    "     _hint_ https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/index.html\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Write the import statement for each of the above cases.\n",
    "     \n",
    "4. Have a look at `tuples`. How are these different from `lists`. Why would you use one over the other?"

    "4. Write a function which finds the largest of a list of numbers. Do not use a method, compare each element to the current maximum. Use a loop.\n",
