    "Python comes 'batteries included'. So, most of what you need to do can be accessed without having to pull some software from the web - it comes in the 'standard library' which is available when you download Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functionality is 'built-in' - this means that it is available without importing a module. Examples of this are the standard data collections such as lists, dicts tuples and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other functionality is available by importing a module. We will look at different ways to do this now. First a few conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    " - _import_ statements should come first in your script\n",
    " - if importing a large number of modules, block them into logical groups - ie modules for string manipulation in one block, a blank line, and then modules for numeric manipulation."
