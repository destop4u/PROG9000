    "One of the key principles of OOP is that of inheritance. With inheritance, we can create a base class, and use this as a template to create other classes which are similar to, but not exactly like the base class. The \"base-class\" is called a parant class, and the derived classes are called the child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we are setting up a car-rental system. We want to create `objects` to help us with both the booking and maintenance of the vehicles. The parent class will contain properties and methods that are relevant for all the different types of vehicles, such as a vehicle id, and a registraion number, and booking status (defualted to `False`). It will also have methods to check if the vehicle is booked, and to actually book the vehicle."
